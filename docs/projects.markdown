I have completed various projects to further my understanding of machine learning techniques. These include working with the Met Office on predicting sea states using weather radar and working with LangChain to create agents based on LLMs. 

I have uploaded some of these projects to GitHub at the following repositories:

**Fantasy Premier League Predictor:**

**Convolutional Neural Network for Landmark Identification:** 
[repo](https://github.com/bencecsiba/Udacity-CNN)
