This project is my attempt at the skin lesion challenge: [link](https://challenge2018.isic-archive.com), [repo](https://github.com/bencecsiba/lesion-classifier/tree/main)

The dataset is located [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T)

To date, I have utilised transfer learning from Resnet18, with my biggest challenge coming from a very imbalanced dataset, a problem that I am currently trying to address using the [imbalanced data sampler](https://github.com/ufoym/imbalanced-dataset-sampler)

My highest accuracy score currently stands at 55%

My next steps will involve utilising the other data included as part of the challenge, including the metadata, as well as utilising different base models.
