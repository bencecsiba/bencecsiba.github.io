This is a website/blog that I intend to use to track my progress through Machine Learning. 

I am always keen to work on new projects and with new technolgoies and new people, please find my resume [here](../assets/Bence_Csiba_resume.pdf)

I built this website using jekyll, you can find its repo [here](https://github.com/bencecsiba/bencecsiba.github.io/)
